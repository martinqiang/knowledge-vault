# Basic Electrical Concepts

## Amperes
Amperes or Amps (A) is the measurement for flow rate of charge. The current of one ampere, is one coulomb of charge going past one given point per second.

### Ampere Hours
Ampere hours (Ah) is the amount of charge transferred by 1 Ampere of current over one hour or 3600 Coulombs. 

The SI unit for Ampere hours is 3600 Coulombs, having dimensions of current (amperes) multiplied by time. (Amperes is already C/t, therefore time cancels and is left with C or coulombs)

There is also milli-Ampere hours. This is Ampere hours divided by 1000.

>[!example]
>If a battery has a capacity of 2500mAh:
>- 2500mAh = 2.5Ah
>- This means with a current of 2.5A, the battery will finish discharging in an hour, or conversely, with a current of 1A, it will discharge in 2.5 hours
>- This also means it stores 3600 C x 2.5Ah = 9000 C. With a current of 2A it will take 4500 seconds or 1.25 hours
