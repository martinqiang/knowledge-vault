## Overview

Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, as assembly depends on the machine code instructions (instruction sets)

### Most common instruction sets
- MIPS
- x86
- ARM


### SPIM
SPIM is a software simulator that runs assembly language programs written for processors that implement the MIPS-32 architecture.
