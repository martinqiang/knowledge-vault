#### Requirements:
- **avrdude** - software to program AVR microcontrollers (acronym for AVR downloader uploader). Using this software, we can program EEPROM, flash memories and even fuse and lock bits. **Note: This is installed with Arduino. Add the executable to environment variables to execute from command line**
