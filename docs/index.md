# Introduction

This site is a digital vault of knowledge collected over the years (also known as a 'second brain). The goal of this is to write down everything I know and want to learn, so that I don't have to memorise everything and rely on Google, but have it at the 'back of my mind' and be able to retrieve the information easily at any time.

## Overview
This website is hosted using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) on GitHub Pages. Pages/Notes are written in Markdown format, which I manage, view, and edit using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It is synced across my devices using [iCloud](https://icloud.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). The theme for the website is [MkDocs - Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

This digital vault is inspired by sites such as [The Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/)
