They spin at high RPM When power is supplied, the DC motor will start spinning until power is removed. Speed can be controlled using PWM . The percentage duty cycle will determine the speed of the motor. If the duty cycle is 50%, the motor will spin at half the speed at 100%. They are used in computer cooling fans and RC car wheels. Suitable for anything that spins at high RPM Servo Motors They are usually 3-wire (power, ground and control). Power is constantly applied. Usually constructed using an assembly of a DC motor, gearing set, control circuit and position-sensor(usually potentiometer). The position of the motor can be controlled precisely, and do not rotate freely like standard DC motors. Angle of rotation is limited to about 180 degrees back and forth from the centre position. The control circuit applies power to the DC motor inside until the shaft turns to the correct position, determined by the position sensor. Note: Servo motors usually have a position error due to dead band caused by friction in the motor. Similar to DC motors, the motor can be controlled using PWM. However, instead of controlling the speed, the PWM control signal determines the position . The PWM control signal tells the servo where to go, which includes staying the same position. Depending on the servo motor, the PWM frequency should be chosen A neutral pulse depending on the servo will keep the servo in the centre position. Increasing/decreasing the pulse width will make the servo turn clockwise/anticlockwise High performance alternative to stepper motors. Suitable to robotic arms/legs, boat rudder control etc. But position is less accurate than stepper motors. Stepper Motor Similar to servo motor in which the position is controlled, but stepper motors uses multiple toothed electromagnets arranged around a central gear to define position. Requires an external control circuit to individually energise each electromagnet to turn the motor shaft. Stepper motor controls position via rotation by fractional increments. Slow, precise, easy setup and control. More accurate than servo motors.
